# OpenCode Compatibility

This extension's flat permission format and evaluation semantics were directly inspired by [OpenCode's permission model](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/) (v1.1.x permission rework).
If you are familiar with OpenCode's permission system, most concepts transfer directly — the same mental model applies.

## What Transfers Directly

The following concepts are shared between OpenCode and this extension:

| Concept                       | Description                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Three actions                 | `allow` / `ask` / `deny` — identical semantics                                                                  |
| Flat `permission` object      | Top-level key in config; surface names as keys                                                                  |
| `"*"` universal fallback      | Sets the default action when no surface-specific rule matches                                                   |
| Granular object syntax        | Surface key → string (catch-all) or `{ pattern: action }` map                                                   |
| Last-match-wins               | When multiple patterns match, the last one in config order wins                                                 |
| `*` wildcard                  | Matches zero or more of any character (including path separators)                                               |
| `?` wildcard                  | Matches exactly one character                                                                                   |
| Home directory expansion      | `~/` and `$HOME/` expand to the OS home directory in patterns                                                   |
| `external_directory` surface  | Gates access to paths outside the working directory                                                             |
| `bash` surface                | Command patterns matched against shell commands                                                                 |
| `skill` surface               | Skill name patterns matched against skill invocations                                                           |
| `task` surface                | Gates subagent/delegation tool calls                                                                            |
| Session-scoped approvals      | `once` / `always` / `reject` from the ask dialog; `always` adds a session rule                                  |
| Per-agent overrides           | Override global permissions for specific agents                                                                 |
| Tool hiding                   | Denied tools are removed before the agent starts (no wasted turns probing)                                      |
| Bash path extraction          | Tree-sitter AST parsing to detect external paths in shell commands (see [details below](#bash-path-extraction)) |
| Bash arity table              | Generates smart approval pattern suggestions (e.g., `git checkout *` not `git *`)                               |
| Trailing wildcard optionality | `"ls *"` matches bare `"ls"` — the trailing `*` is optional                                                     |

If your OpenCode config uses these features, the equivalent works in this extension with minimal translation (see [Porting Guide](#porting-an-opencode-config) below).

### Notable Differences Explained

#### Default Fallback: `allow` vs `ask`

OpenCode defaults to permissive — most tools work without configuration.
This extension defaults to least privilege — omitting `"*"` gives you `"ask"` for everything.

If you want OpenCode-like permissiveness:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "*": "allow",
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

#### File Mutation Surfaces

OpenCode unifies all file writes under a single `edit` permission.
This extension exposes Pi's actual tool names: `write` (create/overwrite) and `edit` (targeted replacement).

To replicate OpenCode's unified behavior, set both to the same action:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "write": "ask",
    "edit": "ask"
  }
}
```

#### MCP Surface (Pi-Only)

This extension provides a first-class `mcp` permission surface with granular server and tool-level control:

```jsonc
{
  "permission": {
    "mcp": {
      "*": "ask",
      "mcp_status": "allow",
      "myServer:*": "ask",
      "dangerousServer": "deny"
    }
  }
}
```

OpenCode does not expose MCP as a configurable permission surface.

#### Bash Path Extraction

Both systems use `web-tree-sitter` + `tree-sitter-bash` to parse shell commands into an AST for `external_directory` path detection, but the extraction strategies differ significantly:

**OpenCode** only extracts paths from a hardcoded allowlist of file-manipulating commands (`rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `chown`, `cat`, plus PowerShell equivalents).
Commands not in the list — including `sed`, `awk`, `grep` — get no path extraction at all.
For allowlisted commands, all non-flag positional arguments are assumed to be paths.

**This extension** extracts path candidates from all commands generically, then applies additional intelligence:

- A `PATTERN_FIRST_COMMANDS` map understands flag arity for `sed`, `awk`, `grep`, `rg`, and similar tools, distinguishing inline patterns/scripts from file arguments to avoid false positives.
- Redirect destinations (`> /path/to/file`) are extracted.
- Heredoc bodies, comments, and variable assignments are skipped.

The result is broader coverage (paths detected in any command, not just a curated list) with fewer false positives on pattern-first commands (no spurious prompts for sed regexes or grep patterns that happen to contain `/`).

## Porting an OpenCode Config

### Before (OpenCode)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "*": "allow",
    "bash": {
      "*": "ask",
      "git *": "allow",
      "npm *": "allow",
      "rm *": "deny"
    },
    "edit": {
      "*": "ask",
      "src/*.ts": "allow"
    },
    "external_directory": {
      "~/projects/*": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

### After (this extension)

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/main/packages/pi-permission-system/schemas/permissions.schema.json",
  "permission": {
    "*": "allow",
    "bash": {
      "*": "ask",
      "git *": "allow",
      "npm *": "allow",
      "rm *": "deny"
    },
    "write": "ask",
    "edit": "ask",
    "external_directory": {
      "*": "ask",
      "~/projects/*": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Translation Steps

1. **Replace `"permission": "allow"`** (top-level string) with `"permission": { "*": "allow" }`.
2. **Split `edit`** into separate `write` and `edit` entries if you need different policies for create vs. modify.
   If not, set both to the same action.
3. **Rename search surfaces**: `glob` → `find`, `list` → `ls`.
4. **Add `.env` rules manually** if you relied on OpenCode's built-in protection.
   The `path` surface is the recommended approach — it covers all tools and bash in one rule:

    ```jsonc
    {
      "permission": {
        "path": {
          "*": "allow",
          "*.env": "deny",
          "*.env.*": "deny",
          "*.env.example": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   Alternatively, use per-tool patterns if you only need to protect specific tools (e.g., `read`):

    ```jsonc
    {
      "permission": {
        "read": {
          "*": "allow",
          "*.env": "deny",
          "*.env.*": "deny",
          "*.env.example": "allow"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5. **Remove OpenCode-only surfaces** (`lsp`, `question`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, `todowrite`, `doom_loop`) — they have no effect in this extension.
6. **Add `mcp` rules** if you use MCP servers — OpenCode has no equivalent, so this is new configuration.
